üí°‚ö°Ô∏è Smartly select range for refactoring under cursor. Imports superb `Alt+Enter` experience of IntelliJ / Android Studio into VSCode! üöÄ

## Features

### Nearest Quick Fix

Automatically expands selection to the region where at least one code action is available, in contrast to `Command+.` (or `Ctrl+.` in Windows) does not show refactoring actions unless selecting a whole expression by hand.

## Requirements

Supported minimum VSCode version is `1.38` (including insider).
Older versions have bug around retrieving code actions, which is fixed in [microsoft/vscode#77999](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/pull/77999).

## Extension Settings

- `intelli-refactor.useCompatSelection`: Enable this if you are using old refactor extension and getting unexpected `No code actions available` message after selection expanded. See [microsoft/vscode#49024](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/49024) for detail. Selection will blink while loading actions.

## Known Issues

Currently only TypeScript/JavaScript is supported.
